    Asynchronously navigates to a URL, identifies all potential fillable fields,
    tests them for input, and returns a list of fields that can be filled.

    This optimized version directly interacts with element handles instead of
    re-querying the DOM with selectors, significantly improving performance.

    Args:
        url: The URL of the webpage to test.
        test_value: The string value to use for testing input fields.

    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a valid,
        fillable field and contains its properties and a recommended selector.
